Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a way of privatising data so that it may not be accessed outside of the class it has been defined in. This reduces
the exposure of data to outside classes.

Although if an outside class requires privitised data it may be collected through the use of getters and setters. This means that 
encapsulation requires slightly more computational power to get and set data.
